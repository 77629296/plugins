## Purpose

This plugin adds the required code to use Redis as a message broker in the service generated by Amplication.

It updates the following parts:
- Adds the required dependencies to `package.json`.
- Adds the required environment variables to `.env`.
- Adds a module `RedisModule` with a service `RedisService` that can be used to send and receive messages.
- Adds the `RedisModule` configured to use Redis to the `app.module.ts` module imports list.
- Adds the required redis service to the `docker-compose.yml` as `docker-compose.dev.yml` files.

## Configuration

The `url` setting is the url of the Redis server. 

The `retryAttempts` setting is the number of times to retry a message.

The `retryDelay` setting is the delay between each message retry attempt.

The `enableTls` setting is set to true when TLS should be used.
