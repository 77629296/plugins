# Amplication plugins

Amplication uses plugins to extend the functionality of the generated application. To add more functionality, you can develop your own plugins, or can use plugins developed by the community, as they become available.

## Using Plugins
Available plugins are listed in the Amplication console. Use the UI to install and activate the required plugins. 

For more information, read [Using Plugins](https://docs.amplication.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started/plugins/)



## Developing Plugins
You will soon be able to develop your own plugins to implement standards, best practices, and custom integrations, and to do almost anything you want with the generated code.
